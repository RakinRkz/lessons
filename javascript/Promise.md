# Promise

- Asynchronous JavaScript is a concept that helps break down complex tasks into smaller tasks, which can be completed using callbacks, promises, or async/await.
- Synchronous systems complete tasks one after another, while asynchronous systems complete tasks independently and at the same time.
- Callbacks are functions nested inside another function as an argument, used to establish a relationship between smaller steps in a complex task.
- Promises were invented to solve the problem of **callback hell** and to better handle tasks, having three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
- Promise chaining is a method of defining what to do when the first task is complete using the `.then` handler, returning a promise when the original promise is resolved.

### 3 states of Promise:

- Pending
- Resolved
- Rejected

```js
let order = ( time, work ) => {

  return new Promise( ( resolve, reject )=>{

    if( is_shop_open ){

      setTimeout(()=>{

       // work is ðŸ‘‡ getting done here
        resolve( work() )

// Setting ðŸ‘‡ time here for 1 work
       }, time)

    }

    else{
      reject( console.log("Our shop is closed") )
    }

  })
}
```
