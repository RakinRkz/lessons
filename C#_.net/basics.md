- Object-Oriented: Supports principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Strongly Typed: Variables are explicitly defined, which helps prevent type errors.
- Automatic Memory Management: Garbage collection handles memory allocation and deallocation.
- Rich Libraries: Extensive libraries for GUI, networking, database access, and more.
- Cross-Platform Development: With .NET Core/.NET 6+, C# applications can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Versatile: Used in various fields, such as game development (Unity), web development (ASP.NET), and enterprise applications.
