# Dealing with Markdown

Markdown is one of the most popular writing format to developers because you can easily put this file in a blog, wiki or readme file.

It has a wide support. 

When I started with my fulltime software engineering job, I had to go through a lot of study materials, keep a lot of notes and eventually wanted to start my own blog from my learnings. 

I first started with Google docs to keep my notes. Why? Because I had previously jumped a lot between many editors and apps such as Notion, Joplin,  Logseq etc. 

There are many factors to consider while choosing such a tool:

- Ease of use
- Sharing with team
- Paywall
- Learning curve, setup pain (this is connected to ease of use)

This time I continued using Google Docs because it has support for markdown(a little bit). I was seeing the benefits of the sharing and organizing using Google Drive.

But after some days I found out that many markdown features important to me wont be easily doable here.

When markdown is exported from Google Docs, there are some things that break.

So I decide to return to directly working with markdown files. This time I will sync with Github and use vscode to edit.

In vscode, I did not like the see in one window, edit in another style of work, which is the reason I abandoned Joplin. I wanted something that is called: WYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get) style editing. I was searching for some extension that will allow me to do so.

Fortunately there are many. I now had to find out the one suitable for me.
